Dotfile structure based on **symlink farm manager [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)**.<br>
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/NoFiYOqnC4o?si=IwDg7Sd0f2mg0v-r&t=480) to get a brief explanation on how to use `stow`.
<br><br>
This is **not** a community facing dotfiles repo; using my biased keybinds, workspaces etc.<br>
But feel free to use whatever you like notheless :)
<br><br>
Use `sudo stow -t / <DOTFILES-DIR>` for folders like sddm, which don't use the usual ~/.config location.
